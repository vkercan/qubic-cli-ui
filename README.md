# Qubic CLI User Interface Proposal

## 1. Goal

Web interface that allows users to execute [Qubic CLI](https://github.com/qubic/qubic-cli) commands (`WALLET`, `BLOCKCHAIN`, `NODE`, `QX`, `QTRY`, `GENERAL`, ...) via the Web interface running in the Cloud or locally using Docker. Current version will not include Qubick wallet integration.
